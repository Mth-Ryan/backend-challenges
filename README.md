## Challenges

The challenges were found in the excellent repository: [CollabCodeTech/backend-challenges](https://github.com/CollabCodeTech/backend-challenges?tab=readme-ov-file). Most of them were written in one of the languages ​​required by the challenge. For languages ​​I wasn't familiar with, like PHP and Ruby, I simply chose Scala due to my affection for the language.

| Language | Company | Stack |     |
